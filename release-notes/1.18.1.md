## Bug fixes

- [AC-1560](https://warthogs.atlassian.net/browse/AC-1560):
  Currently starting the container from an `error` state drops the logs for the container. To inform the user of such a side effect, now a confirmation is required from the user when executing `amc start <container_id>` for an `error` container.
- [AC-1570](https://warthogs.atlassian.net/browse/AC-1570): 
  Creating an application from a directory gives a vague error message (e.g `no such file or directory: /my-app`) which might not reflect the real reason for failure. For e.g in cases where the directory exists but the AMC snap cannot access the directory. Now an intuitive error message is shown in such cases with added information directing the user to check the snap access.
- [AC-1558](https://warthogs.atlassian.net/browse/AC-1558)
  Fix the crash caused by the `boot-application-relaunced` watchdog when streaming the Beach Buggy Racing application in the portrait mode.
- [AC-1600](https://warthogs.atlassian.net/browse/AC-1600)
  Fix the permission denial error when broadcasting `ACTION_CLOSE_SYSTEM_DIALOGS` intent from AOSP calendar app.
- [AC-1606](https://warthogs.atlassian.net/browse/AC-1606)
  Fix the image ID out-of-sync issue when adding an image into AMS. This enables people to launch a raw container with an image ID returned from `amc image add` command.
- [AC-1608](https://warthogs.atlassian.net/browse/AC-1608)
  Fix the `InputReader: Received unexpected event` error when enabling the touch emulation by default. This avoid unexpected events sent from the client to Android container, which causes a bunch of error logs to show up during Android runtime.
- [AC-1624](https://warthogs.atlassian.net/browse/AC-1624)
  Fix the broken graphical output during the game play of `Bingo Blitz`.
- [AC-1625](https://warthogs.atlassian.net/browse/AC-1625)
  Fix the broken graphical output during the game play of `Slotomania`.
