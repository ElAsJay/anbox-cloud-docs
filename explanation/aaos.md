# Android Automotive OS(AAOS)

Since the 1.21.0 release, in addition to providing images based on the Android Open Source Project (AOSP), Anbox Cloud also offers images based on the [Android Automotive OS (AAOS)](https://source.android.com/docs/automotive/start/what_automotive). These images help run Android in automotive infotainment systems at scale.

```{important}
* This is currently an experimental feature.
* The Anbox Cloud AAOS images are based on Android Automotive and *not* Android Auto. For understanding the differences between the two, see upstream documentation on [Android Automotive and Android Auto](https://source.android.com/docs/automotive/start/what_automotive#android-automotive-android-auto).
```

The [Vehicle Abstraction Layer (VHAL)](https://source.android.com/docs/automotive/vhal) enables Android Automotive to communicate with and control the different vehicle hardware controls.
