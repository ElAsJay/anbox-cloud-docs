Building custom images of Anbox Cloud based on AAOS is possible but is not recommended.

[note type="information" status="Note"]Building custom images is possible only for Android 13 and is currently possible for AAOS images only.[/note]

Using customised Anbox Cloud images will lead to more maintenance work on your end:

* You will miss security updates provided by the Anbox Cloud team.
* You will need to update your custom images regularly to stay compatible with Anbox Cloud.
* You will need to perform some manual steps to deploy Anbox Cloud.

It is for these reasons that we generally don't recommend using a custom image unless you have a real business need for it.

If you have a use case that demands an Anbox Cloud image with customisations applied, please [contact us](https://anbox-cloud.io/contact-us).
