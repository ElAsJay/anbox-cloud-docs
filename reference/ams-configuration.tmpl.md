## Objects managed by AMS

AMS manages various objects such as applications, images, instances, nodes and addons. 

The object names must adhere to the following criteria:

* Minimum character limit: 3
* Maximum character limit: 255
* Can contain:
  - Alphabets (a-z, A-Z)
  - Numbers (0-9)
  - Allowed special characters: `-` (hyphen), `_` (underscore), `:` (colon), `.` (period).

When you create an instance, the same criteria apply to the following options as well:

* `boot_activity`
* `platform`
* `boot_package`

The object ids are generated by AMS and have a length of 20 characters.
