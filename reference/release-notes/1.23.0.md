# 1.23.0

The Anbox Cloud team is pleased to announce the release of Anbox Cloud 1.23.0.

Please see [component versions](https://anbox-cloud.io/docs/reference/component-versions) for a list of updated components.

## New features & improvements

### Core stack improvements

* The Anbox Cloud Appliance is overhauled to deliver a much simpler and streamlined version. This new version of the appliance is made available using the [snap epoch feature](https://snapcraft.io/docs/snap-epochs). Existing installations of the appliance are not affected but the old snap with `epoch=0` is {ref}`deprecated <sec-appliance-deprecation>`. For all new installations of the appliance, use the `epoch=1` snap. See the [appliance installation tutorial](https://documentation.ubuntu.com/anbox-cloud/en/latest/tutorial/installing-appliance/) for instructions.
    * The `anbox-cloud-appliance` status command now displays the initialisation status of the appliance and its version. <!--AC-2513-->

* Anbox Cloud now offers a way to connect to remote Android instances securely using the Android Debug Bridge (ADB). You can set up an ADB connection using the dashboard or the CLI. See {ref}`howto-access-instance` for more information.

* Android Automotive OS based images are fully supported starting from this release and no longer considered an experimental feature.<!--AC-2660-->

### Streaming improvements

< List enhancements to streaming stack here. >

### Dashboard improvements

The Anbox Cloud dashboard has the following improvements:

* The *Instances* and the *Sessions* pages and their functionalities are merged to provide an enhanced user experience while streaming.

* The initial VHAL values upon joining a stream are now captured as a default. You can revert to these values using the *Reset* button, when needed.

### Other

* All Anbox Cloud charms now install Snaps directly from the Snap Store instead of using deb packages. Existing installations automatically switch to snap refresh from the store on upgrade.<!--AC-2523-->
* Android security updates for August 2024 (see [Android Security Bulletin - August 2024](https://source.android.com/docs/security/bulletin/2024-08-01) for more information).
* The Android WebView has been updated to [127.0.6533.84](https://chromereleases.googleblog.com/2024/07/chrome-for-android-update_30.html).
* Our documentation is now hosted at [documentation.ubuntu.com](https://documentation.ubuntu.com/anbox-cloud/en/latest). Previous documentation links from the [earlier website](https://anbox-cloud.io) will be redirected to new targets.

    The documentation source is hosted at the public [Anbox Cloud documentation repository on GitHub](https://github.com/canonical/anbox-cloud-docs). We welcome all contributions to the Anbox Cloud documentation using this repository. See [Contribute to Anbox Cloud documentation](https://documentation.ubuntu.com/anbox-cloud/en/latest/contribute/landing/) for more information.

## Removed functionality

< List features that were part of Anbox Cloud so far or that were on the deprecation path for a while and have been removed for the current release >

## Deprecations

* Use of a node controller to manage port forwarding from an instance is deprecated, starting with this release. In 1.23.0, the node controller will still be used for the full Anbox Cloud deployment. For the appliance, the Anbox Management Service (AMS) now uses a LXD proxy device to manage the port forwarding from an instance to expose a service externally or internally.

  In the 1.24.0 release, the node controller will be fully replaced with LXD proxy device for both regular and appliance deployments.<!--AC--2487-->

## Known issues

* WiFi support is not available with Android 14 vendor images. This issue will be fixed in the 1.23.1 release. <!--AC-2647-->
