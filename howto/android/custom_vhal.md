# Replace the Anbox VHAL

*since 1.22.0*

[note type="information" status="Note"]
Replacing the Anbox VHAL is only supported on [AAOS images](https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/24185).
The Anbox Cloud dashboard does not support custom VHAL implementations.
[/note]

This document will guide through the process of replacing the Anbox Cloud VHAL
implementation with your own implementation placed in the
[ODM partition](https://source.android.com/docs/core/architecture/partitions/odm-partitions)
using an [addon](https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/38727).

## Prerequisites

Your custom VHAL implementation must provide an
[HIDL VHAL interface](https://source.android.com/docs/automotive/vhal/hidl-vhal-interface)
and be built against VNDK 29.

If your VHAL implementation requires additional libraries, they must also be
bundled with the addon and copied in the ODM partition.

## Create the addon

This addon will be tasked with the following:

1. Copying the VHAL binary to `/odm/bin/hw`.
1. Copying an
<!-- wokeignore:rule=master -->
[init.rc file](https://android.googlesource.com/platform/system/core/+/master/init/README.md)
for your VHAL service to `/odm/etc/init`.
1. Disabling the Anbox Cloud VHAL by setting the `ro.anbox.automotive.vhal`
property to `odm`. This will be done by writing that system property to the
`/odm/etc/build.prop` file.

In the following example, we will name our addon `custom-vhal`.
To override the VHAL implementation, we will use a
[pre-start hook](https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/28555) which is executed
before Android gets started.

The directory layout for the addon is strict and must be:

```
custom-vhal/
├── hooks
│   └── pre-start
├── manifest.yaml
├── vhal
└── vhal.rc
```

As mentioned in the prerequisites, any additional libraries must also be bundled with the addon.

`vhal` is your custom VHAL implementation.

`vhal.rc` is an [init.rc file](https://android.googlesource.com/platform/system/core/+/main/init/README.md) for your VHAL service, such as:

```
service custom-vhal /odm/bin/hw/vhal
    class hal
    user vehicle_network
    group system inet
    disabled

on property:ro.anbox.automotive.vhal=odm
    start custom-vhal
```

`hooks/pre-start` must be an executable file which will handle the tasks
outlined at the beginning of this section, such as the following bash script:

```bash
#!/bin/bash -x
#
# Copyright 2024 Canonical Ltd.  All rights reserved.
#

ANDROID_ODM_DIR="${ANBOX_DIR}/android-odm"

if [ "${INSTANCE_TYPE}" != base ]; then
    exit 0
fi

# Ensure all needed directories are created
mkdir -p "${ANDROID_ODM_DIR}/etc/init"
mkdir -p "${ANDROID_ODM_DIR}/bin/hw"

# Copy the custom VHAL and the associated init file in /odm
cp "${ADDON_DIR}/vhal" "${ANDROID_ODM_DIR}/bin/hw/"
cp "${ADDON_DIR}/vhal.rc" "${ANDROID_ODM_DIR}/etc/init/"

# Set the ro.anbox.anbox.vhal system property to 'odm'
echo "ro.anbox.automotive.vhal=odm" >> "${ANDROID_ODM_DIR}/etc/build.prop"
```

The addon
[`manifest.yaml`](https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/25293) file
contains metadata:

```yaml
name: custom-vhal
description: |
  Addon replacing the Anbox Cloud VHAL with a custom implementation.
```

Once everything is in place, you can add the addon to your Anbox Cloud instance,
with:

```bash
amc addon add custom-vhal ./custom-vhal
```

Please note that due to Snap strict confinement, the addon directory
(`custom-vhal` here) must be located in the home directory of the user executing
the `amc` command.

## Use the addon

The newly added `custom-vhal` addon must now be enabled to be used with
Anbox Cloud applications.

If you plan to always override the Anbox Cloud VHAL implementation in all
applications, you can
[enable the addon globally](https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/25285):

```bash
amc config set application.addons custom-vhal
```

Otherwise, add it to your
[application manifest](https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/24197):

```yaml
name: my-app
addons:
  - custom-vhal
```
