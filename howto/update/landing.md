The guides in this section describe how to update your Anbox Cloud or Anbox Cloud Appliance installation.

If possible, Anbox Cloud automatically enables [Livepatch](https://ubuntu.com/security/livepatch). Livepatch applies critical Linux kernel patches with zero downtime. You can check whether Livepatch is available for your platform by running `ua status`.
