# Anbox Cloud documentation

This repository hosts the product documentation for Anbox Cloud.

```{important}
The concepts of the Anbox component in Anbox Cloud are similar to the [Anbox open source project](https://github.com/anbox/anbox), but the Anbox open source project is an independent project that is not related to or used in Anbox Cloud.

    Contributing to the Anbox Cloud docs is a great way to improve your documentation and technical communication skills. You’ll get experience writing clear, concise documentation following [Diataxis](https://diataxis.fr/) principles.

- Learn more about Anbox Cloud

    Contributing to the Anbox Cloud documentation can help you broaden your understanding of the product and its related technologies.

### Style and language

Anbox Cloud documentation follows [Diataxis](https://diataxis.fr/) principles. You are particularly encouraged to read up on Diataxis before starting to contribute.

To accommodate different kinds of audience, try to:

- Write content in a tone that’s appropriate for the subject.
- Write inclusively and assume very little prior knowledge of the reader.
- Link or explain phrases, acronyms and concepts that may be unfamiliar, and if unsure, err on the side of caution.

We (mostly) adhere to the [Ubuntu style guide](https://docs.ubuntu.com/styleguide/en). Any deviations from the Ubuntu style guide are documented in the [Anbox Cloud documentation style guide](./anbox-style-guide.md).

### Quality checks
* The following pre-commit checks are run automatically before every commit:
  - Inclusive language checks (`woke`)
  - Spellcheck (`spellcheck`)

#### Running pre-commit checks

To be able to run these pre-commit checks:

* Install the `pre-commit` package from the Ubuntu repositories.
* Install the `aspell` and `aspell-en` packages from the Ubuntu repositories. This is required by the spellchecker.
* Navigate to the top-level directory of this repository and run `pre-commit install --install-hooks`.

#### Overriding pre-commit checks

Enabling pre-commit checks are optional as these checks are executed on pull requests automatically. If you do not want to run these checks before commits or to skip a particular check, use the following tips:

* To disable the pre-commit hook, use `--no-verify` when running `git commit`.
* To skip a particular pre-commit check, prefix `SKIP=<pre-commit-hook-name>` when running `git commit`.
* To allow a valid word that is regularly used in the documentation but is flagged by `spellcheck`, add the word to `.wordlist.txt`.
* In special cases, there are ways to avoid a particular file or text from being flagged by `woke`. See [woke user guide](https://docs.getwoke.tech/ignore/).
