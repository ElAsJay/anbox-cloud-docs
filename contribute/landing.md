# Contribute to Anbox Cloud documentation

Although Anbox Cloud is a closed-source product, the documentation for Anbox Cloud is open and the source is available at https://github.com/canonical/anbox-cloud-docs.

We welcome contributions, suggestions, fixes and constructive feedback from the user community. If you feel something is inaccurate, unclear or broken, you have a number of ways to fix it:

- Fix the issue and [raise a pull request](https://github.com/canonical/anbox-cloud-docs/pulls) against the docs repository.
- Report it as a bug on [Launchpad](https://bugs.launchpad.net/anbox-cloud/+bugs) or on [GitHub](https://github.com/canonical/anbox-cloud-docs/issues/new)
- Talk to us on the [public Matrix channel](https://matrix.to/#/#anbox-cloud:ubuntu.com).

The navigational structure, style, and content of our documentation follows the Di√°taxis systematic framework for technical documentation. This categorises the documentation into tutorials, how-to guides, reference material and explanatory text. 

Consistency is vital in documentation, which is why we request contributors to follow the {ref}`style-guide`. However, do not let this be a barrier to your contribution. You can still submit contributions to the best of your ability, and if something is inconsistent, we will fix it. We are targeting continuous improvement rather than delayed perfection.
